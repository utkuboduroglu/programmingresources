# Collection of programming resources
This is a personal list of resources I generally use for projects or for learning a specific language or library etc.

# Generally applicable resources
### i.e. resources that are usually useful for any project

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for anything & everything related to coding; your best friend when it comes to solving a common problem\
[Google](https://www.google.com/), or your favorite search engine for that matter\
These two sources are the best two sources you can refer to while searching for help regarding programming. No matter the amount of experience you have, these two resources are used by anyone and everyone.

[devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/) -- a website that collects & formats documentation -- for general access to documentation\
[learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) for quick reference to basic syntax and concepts\
[git version control](https://git-scm.com/) to track & maintain projects with ease\
[github.com](https://github.com/), for storing projects & for easy remote use with git\
[goalkicker](https://goalkicker.com/) -- a website for PDF guides -- for thorough reference & specifics\
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) online coding & compiling platform, good barebones solution to collaborating on projects

[vim](https://www.vim.org/) the text editor for all-purpose text processing\
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), a beginner friendly text editor for any operating system and language\
[personal dotfiles](https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/dotfiles) designed for an easier workflow with a linux machine & for coding with vim

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for practice problems in specific languages & programming paradigms\
[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) for larger set of practice problems (language-agnostic)

## Some linux distributions (which I recommend you install for easier programming)
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) the most popular linux distribution available\
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) a different (and in my opinion, more powerful) flavor of Ubuntu\
[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/) A distro based on Arch Linux (my favorite)

[manpages](https://man.cx/) for manual pages (some available for C/C++)

# Language specific resources
## C/C++
[GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for linux based operating systems\
[GNU Project Debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) for debugging executables

[CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), an all purpose Windows, Linux C/C++ IDE (free for students)\
[C++ reference](https://cppreference.com/) for C/C++ syntax/language/library reference\
[Learn C++](https://learncpp.com/) for basic C/C++ with STL tutorial, mostly for beginners

## Python
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for a collection of useful python libraries
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a library for developing dynamic web applications
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) for a tutorial on numpy, plotting & ML in python
