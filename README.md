# Collection of programming resources
This is a personal list of resources I generally use for projects or for learning a specific language or library etc.

# Generally applicable resources
## i.e. resources that are usually useful for any project
[devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/), for general documentation\
[git version control](https://git-scm.com/)\
[github.com](https://github.com/), for storing projects & for easy remote use with git\
[learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) for quick reference to basic syntax and concepts\
[goalkicker](https://goalkicker.com/) for thorough reference & specifics\
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) online coding & compiling platform, good barebones solution to collaborating on projects\

[vim](https://www.vim.org/) the text editor for all-purpose text processing\
[personal dotfiles](https://github.com/utkuboduroglu/dotfiles) designed for an easier workflow with a linux machine & for coding with vim\

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) for practice problems in specific languages & programming paradigms\
[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) for larger set of practice problems (language-agnostic)\

## Some linux distributions (which I recommend you install for easier programming)
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) the most popular linux distribution available\
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) a different (and in my opinion, more powerful) flavor of Ubuntu\
[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/) A distro based on Arch Linux (my favorite)\

[manpages](https://man.cx/) for manual pages (some available for C/C++)\

# Language specific resources
## C/C++
[GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for linux based operating systems\
[CLion IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for all purpose Windows, Linux C/C++ programming (free for students)\
[C++ reference](https://cppreference.com/) for C/C++ syntax/language/library reference\
[Learn C++](https://learncpp.com/) for basic C & C++ with STL tutorial, mostly for beginners\

## Python
